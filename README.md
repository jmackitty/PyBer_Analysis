# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to examine the cost per ride and to see the impact that the amount of drivers and rides has on prices. The goal was to determine what additional resources could be placed in underserved communities and to see what kind of growth opportunities were available for PyBer.
Results:The results of the project determined that there is a correlation betwen the amount of rides and the price of rides. In rural areas, there are less drivers and less rides, so the cost per ride is higher. In urban areas, there are more drivers and more rides so the rides cost less.

## Summary: Based on the results, the following recommendations can be made:
1) Encourage more drivers to join PyBer in rural and suburban areas so more clients can be serviced.
2) Increase the incentives for drivers in rural areas so they are more likely to continue to drive so more customers can be serviced.
3) Conduct surveys in rural areas for customer that use PyBer to see what kind of feedback they have so improvements can be made to the service to reach more people.
